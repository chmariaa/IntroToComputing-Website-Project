    <h3>
      The Painstaking Process of Bringing The Little Prince to Life
    </h3>

    <p class="a-text">
      When director Mark Osborne was asked to adapt The Little Prince, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's beloved 1943
      children's
      book, into an animated film, he hesitated. “Turning this precious book into a big movie would just break it,” said
      Osborne, a two-time Oscar nominee. “The Little Prince feels very lyrical, poetic. It&#39;s not movie-shaped at
      all.”
      The
      cherished story, about the Little Prince&#39;s quest to return home, is rich with philosophy on love and loss and
      enhanced
      by Saint-Exupéry&#39;s whimsical illustrations. To preserve the essence of the book, Osborne decided to use
      computer-generated animation for a larger framing narrative about a lonely girl, then shift to stop-motion
      animation to
      tell the Little Prince&#39;s story, which the girl, known only as Little Girl, learns about from an eccentric old
      neighbor
      voiced by Jeff Bridges.

      “When you&#39;re reading the book, you&#39;re told over and over again in the text, &#39;These drawings aren&#39;t
      very good,&#39; and
      you&#39;re actually being tricked into imagining the reality Saint-Exupéry was trying to depict,” says Osborne
      “There&#39;s a
      charm to those illustrations, and we wanted our stop-motion animation to be charming like they are: handcrafted,
      obviously the work of artists.” Stop-motion production designer Alexander Juhasz, who previously worked on the
      eerie
      children's book in *The Babadook*, led a team of artists to sculpt the tiny characters, all dressed in
      hand-painted
      rice-paper costumes, while staying true to Saint-Exupéry&#39;s illustrations. In the captions for these photos,
      Juhasz
      explains how he combined his own vision of *The Little Prince* with Saint-Exupéry&#39;s. “When you&#39;re
      interpreting
      someone
      else&#39;s designs into your own work,” Juhasz says, “you need to know, &#39;This is home base.&#39; I want our
      film to feel
      like,
      &#39;This is what Saint-Exupéry captured in his writing.’”

      The kind Aviator, shown in the sketches at right, is never depicted in Saint-Exupéry&#39;s book, so Juhasz took
      time
      to
      “nail him down.” He explains, “I wanted him to be this sweet, compelling, relatable guy — it&#39;s about his
      vulnerability
      and getting at something empathetic.”

      “&#39;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly,’” says Juhasz, quoting the book&#39;s Fox character.
      “He&#39;s wise,
      he&#39;s
      elusive. He should feel like a watercolor brushstroke that just dried.” To bring this to life, the team used
      hand-painted fur and a paper tail. “He came to life as this little painting.”

      Juhasz notes, “Saint-Exupéry would draw empty circles for eyes, so we thought, Let&#39;s roll with it — keep
      things as
      simple as possible and give the Little Prince an extremely limited expression set.”

      In the book, “he looks a little wonky,” Juhasz explains. “He has a long oval head, and his hairline sometimes
      starts at
      the back of his neck. He looks balding. We had to get to a point where he&#39;s cute.”

      “He&#39;s a very somber, pensive young man,” Juhasz says of the Little Prince. “So we thought, &#39;Let&#39;s not
      make him a
      caricature.’” While sculpting him, “I tried to think, What would a line drawing look like? His expressions are
      very
      neutral, even his smile.”

      In Osborne&#39;s storyboards, the Businessman whom the Little Prince meets “was this larger-than-life, huge figure
      on
      his
      planet,” Juhasz explains. “He&#39;s like this mountain; he resembles the mountain of paperwork he has. When I
      designed
      him,
      I wanted him to be almost like a turtle coming out of its shell. He&#39;s been sitting at this desk so long,
      he&#39;s,
      like,
      part of the desk.”

      Juhasz struggled with creating the Little Prince&#39;s beloved Rose, voiced by Marion Cotillard in the film. “With
      a
      lot of
      the initial test roses, we&#39;d say, &#39;Oh, wow, that looks nice,&#39; and then the next day go, &#39;Oh, well,
      this just looks
      like
      a paper flower.’” To capture the Rose&#39;s unique beauty, Juhasz asked stop-motion art director Corinne Merrell
      (whose hand
      is seen here) to create something “flatter, more graphic, more interesting. It was a matter of avoiding a cliché
      paper
      flower.”

      This image shows the Little Prince and his treasured rose in a scene from the finished film. “People have strong
      feelings for *The Little Prince*,” Juhasz says. “Our work was so much about protecting those feelings.”
