      Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#39;s Original Watercolors for “The Little Prince”
    </h3>

    <p class="wc-text">
      In April 1943, shortly after The Little Prince was published, 43-year-old Saint-Exupéry handed his friend Silvia
      Hamilton a brown paper bag containing his manuscript and drawings, saying, “I&#39;d like to give you something
      splendid, but
      this is all I have.” He then left for Algiers to serve as a military pilot with the Free French Air Force.
      Although he
      was eight years beyond the age limit for pilots in these squadrons, he persistently petitioned for an exemption,
      which
      was ultimately granted by General Dwight Eisenhower. On July 31, 1944, he departed on a reconnaissance mission and
      was
      never seen again. He was 44 years old at the time of his death — a detail that adds a poignant layer to the fact
      that
      the Little Prince watched the sunset 44 times while on his little planet.

      Years later, parts of Saint-Exupéry's plane were discovered. A fisherman near Marseilles found the author's silver
      bracelet in his net. The inscription on it included Saint-Exupéry's name, his wife's name, and the address of his
      American publisher, with "NYC USA" written as well.

      In 1968, The Morgan Library in New York, home to valuable treasures like rare Islamic paintings depicting the life
      of
      Rumi and illustrated to-do lists by famous artists, acquired the original manuscripts of Saint-Exupéry. A new
      exhibition
      at the Morgan delves into his creative process, showcasing writings he excluded from the final version. The
      manuscript,
      containing 30,000 words—almost double the length of the published book—along with his little-known original
      watercolors
      and other biographical items, offers a deeper insight. Saint-Exupéry was a unique artist, one of the few writers
      who
      also illustrated his own works, like other renowned creators such as Maurice Sendak, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Maira
      Kalman,
      where text and images work together to enrich one another.

      What makes these drawings so special is that they both reflect and challenge Saint-Exupéry's famous line — "What
      is
      essential is invisible to the eye." The drawings try to make visible the creative effort of a man whose story
      continues
      to touch generations with its gentle message about the meaning of life.

      Saint-Exupéry, like many famous writers, had unusual habits and questionable sleep routines. He often wrote late
      into
      the night and had no problem calling a friend at 2 A.M. to read a passage aloud. He always carried a cup of coffee
      or
      tea and usually had a cigarette in his mouth. Unsurprisingly, these habits left their mark on his work, as seen in
      the
      coffee stain on an early manuscript page of The Little Prince.

      When I asked Saint-Exupéry how *The Little Prince* came into his life, he told me that one day he looked at what
      seemed
      like a blank sheet of paper and saw a small, childlike figure. “I asked him who he was,” Saint-Exupéry said.
      “I&#39;m
      the
      Little Prince,” was the reply.

      Saint-Exupéry's beloved character developed mostly in the margins of his letters and notebooks. In a 1940 letter
      to a
      friend, he sketched a character with thinning hair, similar to his own, wearing a bow-tie. He made a similar
      drawing for
      Elizabeth Reynal, a French-speaking friend in New York, who later encouraged him to turn this character into a
      children's story.

      One of the most beautiful pieces in the exhibit is a 1943 review of The Little Prince by P.L. Travers for the
      New
      York Herald Tribune. It echoes Tolkien's belief that there is no such thing as writing "for children" and
      expresses the
      book's profound, timeless appeal with great sensitivity.
